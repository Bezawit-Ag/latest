      <h2>Our promise</h2>
      <p>
        We slow-simmer our wats, hand-grind our berbere and mitmita, and ferment our injera just as our grandmothers taught us.
        Every dish honors traditional Ethiopian techniques while we layer on seasonal produce, local honey wine (tej), and warm Ethiopian hospitality.
